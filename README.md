# SimpleTree

This tool generates a tree diagram and complete material lists for crafting systems.

Run PTPScript.py to generate the crafting tree/materials lists.

You need to have python and pydot installed to run the script.

Raw utputs are held in (surprisingly) the output folder, while zip files are held (incredibly) in the zips folder.

Edit the variables near the top of PTPScript.py to change what the script does.

Feel free to add new crafting systems from other games! Just follow TEMPLATE.TXT to create new items, and name the new folder as [game]mat.
