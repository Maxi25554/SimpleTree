# SimpleTree

You need to have pydot installed to run the script.

Run PTPScript.py to fetch the tree.

Edit the graphing() variable in PTPScript to change the item it fetches.

The item library is in the mats folder

Generating the tree also generates text files. The first (matlist.txt) shows you every item used to produce the final product and the amount, while the second (matlistnat.txt) shows you every natural resource used.
